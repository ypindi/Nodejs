Node never executes our code directly.
It always wraps our module inside of a function.

If you create an error in the 1st line of 3_creatingModule.js
file, when you try to call the logger function in
creatingModules_3.js file, you will get an error.

Because it is an IIFE concept.
There is a module wrapper function and this module wrapper
function has many arguments. One of the argument is the
require function. Hence, require is local to each module.
